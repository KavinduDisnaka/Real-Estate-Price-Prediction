I've completed an end-to-end ***Real Estate Price Prediction project***, where I developed a model to predict house prices using linear regression. This project has been a fantastic learning journey, and I'm thrilled to showcase the skills and techniques I've mastered along the way:

🔍 Data Cleaning: Ensured high-quality data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.

🔧 Feature Engineering: Created and transformed features to enhance model performance.

📊 Data Visualization: Utilized matplotlib to create insightful visualizations that uncover hidden patterns in the data.

✂️ Outlier Removal: Implemented strategies to identify and remove outliers, ensuring robust model predictions.

🛠️ Model Building: Developed a linear regression model using scikit-learn, fine-tuned to deliver accurate predictions.

📈 Linear Regression: Deepened my understanding of linear regression, including its assumptions and application in real-world scenarios.

This project has not only strengthened my data science skillset but also given me practical experience in end-to-end model development.
